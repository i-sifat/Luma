  assets:

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  # assets:
  #   - images/a_dot_burr.jpeg
  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: HindSiliguriBold
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/dailoz_assets/dailoz_fonts/HindSiliguri-Bold.ttf
    - family: HindSiliguriLight
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/dailoz_assets/dailoz_fonts/HindSiliguri-Light.ttf
    - family: HindSiliguriMedium
